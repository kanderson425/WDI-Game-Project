# Hillbillies vs. Aliens!
## Gameplay
Hillbillies vs. Aliens is a shooter game in which the objective is to shoot moving targets (aliens/UFOs) on the screen in mid-flight. The game is played from a *first-person* perspective where the player will take aim at an alien target and will shoot it down from the sky.

The objective is to shoot as many alien spaceships as possible in the allotted time.

## Exposition
*Aliens have landed!*

In the backwoods of Appalachia, you and your clan of hillbilly cousins are living an easy life of moonshine-making, squirrel-hunting and banjo-picking until a horde of alien spaceships attempt to land in your backyard. *Not on your watch!*

With your handy-dandy rifle you are taking matters into your own hands and protecting your property!

# Next Steps
While a great start, this game has functionality and modifications that still need to be made. 

The first modification will be made to the underlying gameplay. The game will consist of multiple "waves" of spaceships that beging populating after the previous wave has finished. With each successive wave, there will be more spaceships and the ships will be moving faster, increasing the overall difficulty.

The second modification will pertain to the 'Reset Game' button. Currently, the button refreshes the entire page and starts the player off at the very beginning of the first (and only) wave. Edits will be made in order to reset the game within the game module without refreshing the entire page.

A third modification to be made will be the addition of a "Start-Menu" landing page that will present itself to the player on load of the game. In this menu, there will be some exposition/instruction on the game objectives and gameplay. This start menu will incorporate hillbilly characters that are interactive.
